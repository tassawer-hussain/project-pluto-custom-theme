Essential components for every WordPress site: share buttons, social links, social media integrations, galleries, lazyload, custom widgets, and more.

== Description ==

We've been developing [premium WordPress themes](https://codesupply.co) for a few years and have always been lacking essentials things in the WordPress core.

There're numerous plugins in the WordPress repository, however if you install them all, there's inconsistency in their backend and frontend styles and possible plugin conflicts.

That's why we created Powerkit, essentials components for every WordPress blog or magazine.

Components have modular structure and can be enabled or disabled with a single click. They have been thoroughly tested and play well together.
