= 4.2.1 =

= 2018-11-28 4.2.0 =

* Fix: Really load all Pro assets when the "Always load assets" option is enabled.

= 2018-11-28 4.2.0 =

* Improved: Prevent ARVE from loading high resolution thumbnails when they are not needed based on the 'Maximal Video Width' setting (defaults to your themes `$content_width` setting if not set) and `maxwidth` shortcode attribute. If you have specific pages where you display video in a grid or multiple in a row you can optimize by giving all videos that are displayed smaller on big screens then your content width or your global 'Maximal Video Width' setting a specific `maxwidth` attribute.

= 2018-11-16 4.1.1 =

* Fix HTML5 video displayed above thumbnail and titles.

= 2018-09-07 4.1.0 =

* Note: PHP versions below 5.6 will no longer be tested and future versions will require at least PHP 5.6
* Improved: Updated 3rd party libs Mobile Detect, objectFitPolyfill and Lity.
* Improved: 3rd party assets are now loaded from jsDelivr CDN. If you do not want this you can load them from your site or let a CDN plugin pick them up with `add_filter( 'nextgenthemes_use_cdn', '__return_false' );` inside a mu-plugin.
* Fix: Some auto thumbnail code was not working properly.
* Fix: Removes WordFence malware warning by removing a comment in Mobile Detect that pointed to a malware infected domain.

= 2018-02-20 4.0.4 =

* This is also a test if the auto update process works for everyone, please let me know if you have issues.

* Fix: Vimeo private videos showing 404 API errors instead of videos.
* Fix: Prevent a PHP notice.
* Improved: Renamed \"Grow on click\" to \"Expand on click\" in dialog. Better English right?

= 2017-05-04 4.0.1 =

* Fixed: inview-lazyload not working correctly.

= 2017-05-04 4.0.0 =

* New: \'volume\' attribute takes 1-100 for HTML5 video.
* Improved: Simplified the inview-lazyload option to on/off - was getting to complicated. On uses it when it makes sense (on all mobiles, and when there is no thumbnail detected or set).
* Improved: Scripts like inview and lity lightbox are now only loaded when they are actually needed.
* Improved: Pointer cursor when hovering over the thumbnails, for themes that do not already add it.

= 2017-04-30 3.9.5 =

= 2017-04-03 3.9.4 =

* Improved: Updated that Mobile_Detect class.
* Improved how aspect ratio is handled with HTML5 videos.

* Some minor code improvements.
